INVESTIGATIVE METHODOLOGY:

1. ACTIVITY ANALYSIS WITH CONFIDENCE LEVELS:
   - Multiple timezone candidates are provided with confidence percentages
   - IMPORTANT: Consider ALL candidates, not just the highest confidence one
   - Look for corroborating evidence (name, company, projects) to select the best match
   - High confidence (70%+): Strong behavioral pattern match
   - Medium confidence (40-70%): Possible but has inconsistencies
   - Low confidence (<40%): Unusual patterns detected, likely wrong timezone
   - When work starts before 6am, the detected timezone is probably WRONG
   - 🕐 DAYLIGHT SAVING CONTEXT: When activity spans DST transitions (spring & fall):
     * UTC-7 could mean Mountain Standard Time (Denver) OR Pacific Daylight Time (SF)
     * UTC-6 could mean Central Standard Time (Chicago) OR Mountain Daylight Time (Denver)
     * Use contextual clues to disambiguate between adjacent timezone possibilities
     * 🌍 DST NON-OBSERVANCE: Some regions don't use DST (Arizona, Saskatchewan, most of Asia/Africa/South America)
     * If user is in non-DST region, UTC offset is consistent year-round (no ambiguity)
   - LUNCH TIMING VALIDATION: Use lunch hours as a strong timezone confidence signal:
     * High lunch confidence (75%+) with reasonable timing (11:30am-2:30pm) = STRONG timezone validation
     * Normal lunch times (12:00-13:00) strongly support the detected timezone
     * Very early lunch (before 11am) or very late lunch (after 2:00pm) suggests wrong timezone
     * No detected lunch pattern may indicate insufficient data or wrong timezone

2. TIMEZONE TO LOCATION MAPPING:
   ⚠️  IMPORTANT: When activity spans DST transitions (spring & fall months):
   UTC offsets reflect the MIXED pattern across seasons, so interpret carefully:
   - UTC-8: Pacific Standard Time - likely San Francisco, Seattle, LA, Vancouver (CA), Victoria (CA)
   - UTC-7: Mountain Standard Time OR Pacific Daylight Time - likely Denver, Boulder, Salt Lake City, Phoenix, Calgary (CA), Edmonton (CA)
   - UTC-6: Central Standard Time OR Mountain Daylight Time - likely Chicago, Dallas, Austin, Mexico City, Winnipeg (CA), Regina (CA)
   - UTC-5: Eastern Standard Time OR Central Daylight Time - likely NYC, Toronto (CA), Boston, Atlanta, Montreal (CA), Ottawa (CA)
   - When uncertain between adjacent zones, use additional signals (name, projects, lunch timing)
   - UTC-3: Brazil/Argentina - likely São Paulo, Buenos Aires
   - UTC+0: GMT - likely London, Dublin, Lisbon
   - UTC+1: CET - likely Warsaw, Berlin, Paris, Madrid, Amsterdam, Prague, Stockholm
   - UTC+2: EET - likely Kiev, Helsinki, Athens, Cairo, Tel Aviv, Espoo (Finland)
   - UTC+3: Moscow Time - likely Moscow, Istanbul, Nairobi
   - UTC+5.5: India - likely Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi
   - UTC+8: China/Singapore - likely Beijing, Singapore, Perth, Manila
   - UTC+9: Japan/Korea - likely Tokyo, Seoul
   - Always pick the MAJOR TECH HUB in that timezone unless evidence suggests otherwise

3. ORGANIZATIONAL INTELLIGENCE:
   - Company/org memberships reveal industry focus and likely geographic clusters
   - Security companies (Chainguard, etc.) → often US-based with distributed teams
   - European companies → likely European developers, but may have developers in India or China
   - Asian companies → likely Asian developers
   - MOUNTAIN TIME INDICATORS: Look for Mountain West signals:
     * Caving/spelunking interests → Colorado has extensive cave systems (UTC-7)
     * Outdoor/adventure sports → Mountain states lifestyle
     * University connections to Colorado, Utah, Arizona schools
     * Projects related to mining, energy, or outdoor recreation
    - The word "Nordic" or "Nordix" implies Scandinavia or Finland
   - Check company names and email domains in bio/profile for location hints
   - Look for location-specific GitHub orgs/projects

4. LINGUISTIC FORENSICS:
   - British vs American spelling reveals English-speaking region
   - Technical writing style and cultural references
   - Name etymology can be a strong weight when there is a clear match to an adjacent timezone
       → Many Arabic speakers work in Nordic countries, Germany, France
     * Chinese names (Quan, Tian, Wei, Wang, Li, Zhang, Chen, Liu, Zhao, Wu, Zhou, Yang, Huang, Xu) = STRONGLY suggests China (Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen)
       → If detected timezone is UTC+1/+2/+3 but name is clearly Chinese, strongly consider UTC+8 instead
       → If work hours start before 6am or after 11am local time, this is a strong signal the timezone is wrong
       → Chinese developers often have irregular hours or incomplete GitHub data
       → DaoCloud, KubeSphere, Karmada are Chinese companies/projects
       → VMware has major offices in Beijing and Shanghai
     * Japanese names (ending in -moto, -mura, -yama, -uchi) = likely Japan (Tokyo, Osaka)
     * Korean names (Kim, Park, Lee, Choi) = likely South Korea (Seoul)
     * Polish or Romanian names in China are very unlikely - it's more likely that they are just working unusual hours.
     * If you have no evidence other than name and activity hours, don't be afraid to shift someone to a nearby timezone/location that is more likely

5. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - PR/issue topics reveal industry focus and geographic context
   - Mention of conferences, events, local references
   - Time-sensitive communications that reveal working hours
   - Repository names and descriptions:
     * Language-specific repos (e.g., hindi-nlp, chinese-bert) suggest native speakers
     * Local business/service repos (e.g., mumbai-local-train, berlin-housing) indicate residence
     * Country-code suffixed repos (e.g., isitholidays-fi for Finland, -se for Sweden)
     * Nordic projects (Nordix, metal3) suggest Scandinavia/Finland
     * Timezone-specific tools or configs suggest user's timezone
   - PR/Issue content clues:
     * References to local time ("I'll fix this tomorrow morning")
     * Mentions of local events, meetups, or offices
     * Currency symbols (₹ for India, € for Europe, ¥ for Japan/China)
     * Date formats (DD/MM vs MM/DD) can hint at region

LOCATION INFERENCE RULES:

1. ALWAYS MAKE AN EDUCATED GUESS: Never return "UNKNOWN" - pick the most likely major city in the detected timezone
2. USE BAYESIAN REASONING: Combine multiple weak signals into strong inferences
3. TECH HUB BIAS: Developers cluster in major tech cities - prioritize these
4. BEHAVIORAL OVER CLAIMS: Trust activity patterns over profile statements UNLESS name/company strongly indicates otherwise
5. CONFIDENCE LEVELS: Provide location with confidence assessment (high/medium/low)
6. PROJECT ASSOCIATIONS: Heavy contribution to region-specific projects is a STRONG signal:
   - KubeSphere, Karmada, OpenELB = Chinese projects → likely China
   - tcet-opensource = Mumbai → likely India
   - Nordix, Metal3 = Nordic projects → likely Sweden/Finland/Norway/Denmark
   - Repository with -fi suffix (e.g., isitholidays-fi) = VERY STRONG Finland signal
   - When Nordix + Metal3 + -fi repo appear together → almost certainly Finland/Nordic
   - Activity in multiple regional projects outweighs timezone if off by 1-2 hours
7. COUNTRY-CODE TLD MATCHING: When user's website has a country-code TLD that aligns with the detected timezone, this is EXTREMELY STRONG evidence:
   - .ca domain + UTC-6 timezone = STRONGLY suggests Canada (Toronto, Winnipeg, Regina over US (Chicago, Dallas)
   - .ca domain + UTC-5 timezone = STRONGLY suggests Canada (Toronto, Montreal) over US (NYC, Miami)
   - .ca domain + UTC-7 timezone = STRONGLY suggests Canada (Calgary, Edmonton) over US (Denver, Phoenix)
   - .ca domain + UTC-8 timezone = STRONGLY suggests Canada (Vancouver, Victoria) over US (Seattle, SF)
   - .uk domain + UTC+0 timezone = STRONGLY suggests UK (London) over Portugal (Lisbon)
   - .de domain + UTC+1 timezone = STRONGLY suggests Germany (Berlin) over France (Paris)
   - .fr domain + UTC+1 timezone = STRONGLY suggests France (Paris) over Germany (Berlin)
   - .nl domain + UTC+1 timezone = STRONGLY suggests Netherlands (Amsterdam)
   - .au domain + UTC+10 timezone = STRONGLY suggests Australia (Sydney, Melbourne)
   - .nz domain + UTC+12 timezone = STRONGLY suggests New Zealand (Auckland)
   - .in domain + UTC+5:30 timezone = STRONGLY suggests India
   - .jp domain + UTC+9 timezone = STRONGLY suggests Japan
   - .cn domain + UTC+8 timezone = STRONGLY suggests China
   - When multiple locations share the same timezone, ALWAYS prefer the location matching the ccTLD
   - This evidence is so strong it should override most other signals except overwhelming contrary evidence
   - Location-specific repositories also provide strong evidence:
     * Repository named after a city/region that matches the timezone = STRONG location signal
     * e.g., "toronto-transit" repo + UTC-5 = likely Toronto, not NYC
     * e.g., "berlin-housing" repo + UTC+1 = likely Berlin, not Paris
     * e.g., "vancouver-meetup" repo + UTC-8 = likely Vancouver, not SF
     * pycon.ca or other .ca conference repos + Canadian timezone = VERY STRONG Canada signal
     * Regional conference/meetup repos are especially strong indicators
8. WORK HOURS & LUNCH SANITY CHECK: If work hours or lunch seem unreasonable, reconsider the timezone:
   - Starting work before 6am local time is VERY unusual - consider alternative timezones
   - Working past midnight regularly suggests either wrong timezone or shift work
   - LUNCH TIMING CROSS-CHECK: Lunch outside 11:30am-2:30pm suggests wrong timezone
     * Lunch at 9am or 4pm local time = probably wrong timezone (off by 2-3 hours)
     * High lunch confidence (75%+) but unreasonable timing = strong signal to try adjacent timezones
   - For Chinese names with work starting at 3am in Europe, strongly consider UTC+8 instead
   - For Indian names with work starting at 4am in Europe, strongly consider UTC+5:30 instead
8. WHEN IN DOUBT: If strong name/company evidence conflicts with activity timezone, consider:
   - User may have relocated but kept their name/connections
   - User may work unusual hours or night shifts
   - User may align with a remote team's timezone
   - IMPORTANT: Developers in India/Asia often work in their company's HQ timezone:
     * Indian working for HERE Maps Berlin = may show European activity from Mumbai
     * Chinese developer at US company = may show Pacific timezone from Beijing
     * This is especially common in global tech companies
   - Pick the location that best fits ALL evidence combined, with strong weight on name+company
