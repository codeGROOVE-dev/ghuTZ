🔴 MANDATORY CONSTRAINT - THIS OVERRIDES ALL OTHER SIGNALS:
If activity_timezone candidates are provided (e.g., "Top 5 candidates: UTC+12, UTC+9, UTC+11, UTC+10, UTC+8"):
- You MUST select a timezone within ±1 hours of one of the top 5 candidates
- The TOP CANDIDATE has the highest confidence based on evening activity, lunch timing, and sleep patterns
- Activity patterns represent ACTUAL behavior and cannot be ignored
- Name etymology, company location, and other signals can only influence WHICH candidate to pick, not override them entirely
- Example: If candidates are UTC+10/+11/+12, you CANNOT pick Europe/Moscow (UTC+3) even for a Russian name
- Example: If top candidate is UTC-4 with 42%% confidence, prefer Eastern US/Canada over Pacific

DETECTION PRIORITIES (subject to above constraint):

1. 🏆 REPOSITORY GEOGRAPHY (HIGHEST within activity constraint):
   - Repo names with locations = strongest evidence ("ncdmv-app" = North Carolina, "toronto-meetup" = Toronto)
   - 🇨🇦 CRITICAL: pycon.ca, .ca domains, or Canadian conference repos = STRONG Canada signal (prefer Toronto/Montreal/Ottawa)
   - Government/civic repos suggest location IF compatible with activity patterns
   - US state names/codes in repos = US location (but must match activity timezone)
   - 🇧🇷 CRITICAL: BVSP/Bovespa repositories = Brazilian Stock Exchange = STRONG Brazil signal (prefer over Argentina)
   - If someone with a Russian name isn't contributing to Russian projects, chances are they are in another country
     in the same timezone, like Australia.

2. NAME CLUES (ONLY to disambiguate between viable candidates):
   - Name etymology helps choose between similar timezones
   - Polish names + EU timezone activity = Poland (Warsaw)
   - Chinese names + Asian timezone activity = China (Beijing, Shanghai)
   - Russian names + Pacific activity (UTC+10/+11) = Vladivostok/Far East Russia, NOT Moscow
   - Belgian/Flemish names + UTC+0/+1 activity = Belgium
   - Portuguese names + UTC+0 activity = Portugal
   - German surnames (like Knabben) + UTC-3 activity + Brazilian context = Southern Brazil (German immigration areas)
   - UTC-3 timezone: Argentina (Buenos Aires) OR Brazil (São Paulo, Rio, Brasília, Southern states)
   - A Russian name (like Mikhail Mazurskiy) in UTC-10 is more likely to be in Sydney than Russia - unless they work with Russian projects.
   - ⚠️ NEVER let name override activity by more than 2 hours

3. COMPANY CLUES (weak signal):
   - ⚠️ CAUTION: Don't assume employees work at company HQ - remote work is very common
   - ⚠️ CRITICAL: If activity strongly suggests Eastern Time (UTC-4/5), don't default to Seattle/SF
     just because of tech company
   - Only use company location if it matches activity patterns
   - Being a Ukrainian company, GitLab employees are more likely to live in Ukraine than Russia
   - Company names may be GitHub org names, like "@gitlabhq" being a reference for GitLab
   - References to country-specific organizations in commit messages or repositories indicate a country
     strongly (for example, BVSP for Brazil, FTC for USA)

4. ACTIVITY PATTERNS (HARD CONSTRAINTS):
   - Work before 5am local = wrong timezone (5-6am acceptable for some)
   - Lunch outside 11am-2:30pm = wrong timezone likely
   - Sleep period should be 4-9 continuous hours of low/no activity between 10pm-8am local time
   - If "Detected sleep hours UTC" is provided, validate that your timezone places sleep in nighttime hours
   - Evening activity (7-11pm) is common for open-source developers, but not universal
   - If activity shows clear sleep/work/lunch patterns, trust them over geographic hints
   - 🚨 CRITICAL: If sleep hours would be during daytime (e.g., 3pm-11pm local), REJECT that timezone

4. HOBBY & INTEREST SIGNALS (STRONG REGIONAL INDICATORS):
   - 🏔️ Caving/spelunking interests + US timezone = HIGH chance of Mountain timezone (Colorado, Utah, New Mexico)
   - 🧗 Rock climbing/mountaineering + US = Mountain or Pacific timezone likely
   - Skiing/snowboarding repositories + US = Mountain states (Colorado, Utah) or Northeast
   - Desert/canyon references + US = Southwest (Arizona, Utah, New Mexico)
   - Location hints from social media or personal websites should weigh heavily on your recommendation

5. LINGUISTIC HINTS:
   - British vs American spelling
   - Spanish words would strongly suggest living in a Spanish-speaking country
   - 🇲🇽 CRITICAL: .mx domains (like puerco.mx) = STRONG Mexico signal (Mexico City UTC-6)
   - 🇲🇽 Spanish words + UTC-6 activity = Mexico City likely (not US Mountain time)
   - Date formats (DD/MM vs MM/DD)
   - Country TLD domains (.ca, .fi, .de, .mx, .br, .ar)

6. Timezone Generation
   - Trust in the confidence levels we provide
   - Return the most appropriate and specific tz database entry for this user. For example, use
     Europe/Warsaw if we think they are in Poland, and Europe/Berlin if we think they are in Germany.
   - For US Mountain timezone, use America/Denver (or America/Phoenix for Arizona)
   - Look carefully at the activity period, as it may cross a daylight savings time boundary!
     Give the appropriate timezone for the current moment (now).
   - If the timezone overlaps with the United States of America, and you don't see any clues that
     lean toward another country, default to the USA
    - Consider that most cities in the US & Europe respect Daylight Savings Time and may be in one UTC offset
      or the other based on the activity timespan.

7. Location & GPS Coordinate Generation
	- Guess a specific city in the timezone that would be the most likely with all evidence given
	- Assume they live near a tech hub, but prefer small towns/cities/countries if you have even a tiny signal pointing there
	- 📍 ALWAYS provide exact GPS coordinates for your detected location:
	• NEVER return 0,0 - always make your best guess based on available evidence
	- If you have private knowledge of where someone lives, lean into it.
	- If you have any evidence that they may live in a small town or city, present that location.
	- A single minor country indicator is a strong enough signal to prefer that country within a timezone
	- 🚨 UTC-3 clues: look for subtle Brazil indicators
	  • BVSP/Bovespa in repos = Brazil (São Paulo likely)
	  • Portuguese content, .br domains = Brazil
	  • German surname + UTC-3 = Often Southern Brazil (Florianópolis, Porto Alegre, Curitiba)
	  • If no evidence for Brazil or Argentina exists, assume UTC-3 users are actually in the United States
	- 🚨 UTC-4 clues: look for subtle Canada indicators
	  • E-mails, websites, or repository names with "ca" or Canadian references should strongly bias toward Canada
	- 🚨 UTC-6 clues: look for subtle Mexico indicators:
	  • Any Spanish content, Mexican cultural references, or .mx domain = Mexico

Seriously though, if they have a .ca e-mail address or .ca website, they almost certainly live in Canada. Do not assign them to New York.

Response example: { "detected_timezone": "America/Toronto", "detected_location": "Toronto, ON, Canada",
